# RSI Period Explained

## What is RSI Period?

```
RSI Period = Number of time intervals used to calculate RSI
- Shorter period (e.g., 7) = More sensitive, more signals
- Longer period (e.g., 14) = Less sensitive, fewer signals
```

## Common Periods

```
7  periods = Very sensitive (more trades)
14 periods = Standard (balanced)
25 periods = Less sensitive (fewer trades)
```

## Example with Different Periods

```
Price: 100 → 105 → 103 → 106 → 104 → 107

7-period RSI:  More reactive to recent changes
              Generates more buy/sell signals
              Better for short-term trading

14-period RSI: Less reactive
              Filters out "noise"
              Better for longer-term trends
```

## Our Current Setup

```
7-period RSI = More sensitive, more signals
```

Why 7 periods?

1. Faster reaction to price changes
2. More trading opportunities
3. Better for volatile crypto markets
4. Quicker mean reversion signals
